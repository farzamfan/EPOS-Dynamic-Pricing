### Dataset ###
#The folder name in the datasets path. Make sure it has no spaces, tabs or newlines (alphanum and underscore preferred)
dataset=gaussian


### Basic epos properties ###
# any integer > 0
numSimulations=1

# any integer > 0
numIterations=40

# any integer > 0
numAgents=100

# any integer > 0
numPlans=16

# any integer > 0
numChildren=2

# exact dimensionality from the dataset
planDim=100


### Shuffle seeds ###

# initial agent structure before reorganization occurs, any integer > 0
shuffle=0

# path to a file containing permutation of indices, need its strucure: sphinx one column: integer index in each row
shuffle_file="permutation.csv" 

### Weights of the global complex cost ###
numberOfWeights = 9
weightsString = "0.0,1.0,1.0,T,0.0,T,0.0,T,0.0"
# number of weights used in EPOS cost function
# weights are in string format, separated by "," -- alpha, beta, w_i
# the weights are: alpha, beta, incentiveRate, priceWeight, preferenceWeight, queueWeight


### Reorganization strategy ###

# possible values: periodically, convergence, globalCostReduction, never. never_strategy: never does reorganization
strategy=never

# any integer > 0, if "periodically" strategy is chosen
periodically.reorganizationPeriod=3

# any positive integer (>0), if "convergence" strategy is chosen, the iteration at which the selections will be memorized to be sued after the following reorganization
convergence.memorizationOffset=5

# double from [0, 1]
globalCost.reductionThreshold=0.5

# any integer. Keep the same seed to reproduce experiment results, what random permutations each strategy will explore, result reproducability
strategy.reorganizationSeed=0
